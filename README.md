# Computational Data Analysis - AMR

This repo contains the project on AMR (Antimicrobial resistance) as a part of [02582 Computational Data Analysis](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2016-2017/02582) taught at [Danish Technical University](http://www.dtu.dk/english).

The goal of this project is to conduct investigation on the relations between intake of antibiotics and bacterial resistance for medicines based on the feces samples collected from swine and poultry in 8 different countries.
