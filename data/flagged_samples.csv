9001	18	001	900118001	BG	Poultry	Sample ID says pooled poultry feces, but shows a bacteriome and resistome very similar to 900117001 and other pooled pig feces. Host DNA analysis confirmed that both samples are from pigs. There does exists a poultry questionnaire from farm 9001.	remove from MG results, wrong lib prep	maybe
2062	17	001	206217001	DE	Pig	The feces pool is wrongly numbered as the bacteriome is clearly from poultry. Host DNA analysis shows pig and poultry DNA.	remove from MG results, wrong lib prep	no, qpcr samples are labeled correctly
2076	18	001	207618001	DE	Poultry	Needs to be deleted, very low amount of reads	remove from MG results	maybe
7020	17	001	702017001	PL	Pig	Looks a bit weird, poultry alike in first MG observationsâ€¦ Needs more looking into.. 	looking into..	maybe
1001	17	001	100117001	NL	Pig	3 different pools made on 1 farm during pilot phase. No questionnaire data available.	Not used for further EFFORT analysis

5001	17	001	500117001	BE	Pig	3 different pools made on 1 farm during pilot phase. Farm is used for further statistical analysis (questionnaire data is available). 1 of the pools needs to be selected for further analysis, or results need to be pooled. For now samples from all pools are selected for qPCR, this can still be changed.	Make decision about selection or pooling.	maybe

9039	18	008	903918008	BG	Poultry	You would expect 001 as serial number, as there should be only 1 pool made. ID's are being checked with countries for confirmation that nothing is different from samples ending with 001.  Farm 5001 and 1001 have really 3 different pools.		no

1009			1009	NL	Pig	Only questionnaire data available, no MG or qPCR. Samples were lost. 	Not used for EFFORT analysis	
5002			5002	BE	Poultry	Only questionnaire data available, no MG or qPCR	Not used for EFFORT analysis	maybe
9004			9004	BG	Pigs	Only questionnaire data available, no MG or qPCR tubes. The data for second 9001 farm (pig farm) probably?	At IRAS we look again into the farm mix up.
